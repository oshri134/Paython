# Getting started with Python
The `>>>` means that Python is ready and we can enter a command. The
basic idea is really simple: we enter a command, press Enter, enter
another command, press Enter and keep going.


## Comments

**Comments are text that does nothing.** They can be created by typing a
`#` and then some text after it, and they are useful when our code would
be hard to understand without them.

```python
>>> 1 + 2     # sum 1 and 2
3
>>>
```

The space after the `#` and multiple spaces before it are just to
make things easier to read.

If we write a comment on a line with no code on it, the prompt changes
from `>>>` to `...`. The prompt goes
back to `>>>` when we press Enter again.

```python
>>> # hello there
...
>>>
```
