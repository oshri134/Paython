## Strings

We can create strings by simply writing some text in quotes.

```python
>>> 'hello'
'hello'
>>> 'this is a test'
'this is a test'
>>> 
```

Strings can also be written with "double quotes" instead of 'single
quotes'. This is useful when we need to put quotes inside the string.

```python
>>> "hello there"
'hello there'
>>> "it's test"
"it's test"
>>> 
```

Strings can be joined together easily with `+` or repeated with `*`:

```python
>>> "3" + "7"
'37'
>>> "hello" + "world"
'helloworld'
>>> "hello" * 3
'hellohellohello'
>>> 
```
