# number short assigning
To do something to a variable (for example, to add something to it) we
can also use `+=`, `-=`, `*=` and `/=` instead of `+`, `-`, `*` and
`/`. The "advanced" `%=`, `//=` and `**=` also work.

```python
>>> a += 2           # a = a + 2
>>> a -= 2           # a = a - 2
>>> a *= 2           # a = a * 2
>>> a /= 2           # a = a / 2
>>> a %= 2           # a = a % 2
>>> a **= 2          # a = a ** 2
>>> a //= 2          # a = a // 2 

```

# string short assigning

```python
>>> a = 'hello'
>>> a *= 3
>>> a += 'world'
>>> a
'hellohellohelloworld'
>>>
```
